# Grade-calculating-problem
CSIE25460 /Programming Language and Compilers/ \n
Programming Languages Track:
Practice on programming the same two exercisesin 5 different programming languages:
Java, Python, R, ML, and Prolog. You may integrate the two programming exercises (A and B in the following) into one program for each programming language.
=> Programming Exercises: The attached file HW2data.csv has the scores of
a class: HW1, HW2, HW3, Midterm, and Final.
A) The overall score of a student is calculated by the following formula:
Score = HW1 * 0.1 + HW2 * 0.1 + HW3 * 0.1 + Midterm * 0.3 + Final * 0.4
Write a program in each of the above 5 different programming languagesto calculate the overall scores of all students. Round off the overall scores to 2 decimal digits.
B) The grade of a student is translated according to the following table:
Score  |Grade
0-49   |E
50-59  |D
60-62  |-C
63-66  |C
67-69  |C+
70-72  |-B
73-76  |B
77-79  |B+
80-84  |-A
85-89  |A
90-100 |A+
Write a program in the above 5 different programming languages to translate the overall score of each student into a grade. 
Round off the overall scores into integers before looking up the table.
Note that for Java, Python, and R, it is required to read the grade
standards from HW2grade.csv, while for ML and Prolog, it is allowed
to give the grade standards in the program
